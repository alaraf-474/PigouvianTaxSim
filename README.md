# PigouvianTaxSim

A command-line Java 17 simulation to demonstrate the effect of a **Pigouvian tax** on negative externalities using aluminum production as a case study.

##  Concept

This project models the basic economic principle where a government imposes a tax equal to the marginal external cost (MEC) to align private cost with social cost. The result is a corrected equilibrium â€” less quantity, higher price â€” that internalizes the externality.

Inspired by:
> "Pigouvian tax: a solution to negative externality" â€” classical microeconomic theory.

##  Features

- Java 17 CLI application
- Calculates equilibrium price and quantity:
  - âœ… With no tax
  - âœ… With Pigouvian tax
- Outputs market adjustments
- Designed for educational demos, simulations, and testing
